      <h2>What is the FAA HIMS Program?</h2>
      <p>HIMS (Human Intervention Motivation Study) is an FAA program originally designed for pilots recovering from substance abuse. Over time, it has expanded to cover a range of mental health conditions, often with the same protocols—lengthy monitoring, expensive evaluations, and stigma.</p>

      <h2>What are pilots saying in forums?</h2>
      <p>In communities like r/flying and the HIMS Victims forum, pilots have voiced concern about the program’s broad scope:</p>
      <blockquote>“It’s no longer just drug/alcohol—it’s mental health, ADHD, PTSD, depression—they’re all treated the same with excessive testing and stigma.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“The system needs science and compassion, not punishment. We’re pilots, not criminals.”</blockquote>
      <p>This reflects a growing sentiment that reform is not optional—it’s urgent.</p>
