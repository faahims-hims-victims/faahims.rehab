  <h1>FAA HIMS FAQ & Pilot Advocacy</h1>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt><strong>What is the FAA HIMS Program?</strong></dt>
    <dd>
      The Human Intervention Motivation Study (HIMS) program is managed by the FAA to evaluate and monitor pilots who have histories involving substance use or mental health concerns. The process involves ongoing testing, counseling, and supervision.
    </dd>

    <dt><strong>Why do pilots oppose how HIMS is currently managed?</strong></dt>
    <dd>
      Drivers of reform include a lack of objective medical criteria, high costs for testing and therapy, and limited ability to return to flight status quickly. The program tends to conflate diverse medical issues into one uniform process, regardless of individual circumstances.
