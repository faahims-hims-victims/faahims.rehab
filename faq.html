  <h1>FAA HIMS FAQ & Reform Resources</h1>

  <h2>What is the FAA HIMS Program?</h2>
  <p>The Human Intervention Motivation Study (HIMS) program is the FAA’s path for pilots needing medical reinstatement due to substance-use or mental health conditions. Critics highlight concerns such as opaque decision-making, one-size-fits-all procedures, and potential for unfair flagging.</p>

  <h2>Where can I learn more or get involved?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pilots for HIMS Reform</strong>: A grassroots group advocating for transparency and legislative reform, including the proposed <em>Pilots for HIMS Reform Act of 2025</em>. They offer tools, personal stories, and legal insights. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}</li>
    <li><strong>FAAHIMSProgram.com</strong>: Independent site discussing the need for oversight, scientific standards, and individualized support within HIMS. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What are pilots in forums saying?</h2>
  <p>On pilot forums and Reddit communities like r/flying, sentiment is high. One pilot sums it up:</p>
  <blockquote>
    “It’s no longer just drug/alcohol—it’s mental health, ADHD, PTSD, depression—they’re all treated the same with excessive testing and stigma.” :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
  </blockquote>
  <p>Others emphasize that reform is critical, not optional: they advocate for scientific, empathetic approaches that let pilots return to flying with dignity. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}</p>
