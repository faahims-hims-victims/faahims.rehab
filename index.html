      <h2>üì¢ What is the FAA HIMS Program?</h2>
      <p>The HIMS (Human Intervention Motivation Study) Program is the FAA‚Äôs approach to managing pilots with substance abuse or mental health diagnoses. While its intentions were sound, the program has grown controversial for lack of transparency, scientific rigor, and for its treatment of pilots with non-substance mental health conditions.</p>
