      <h2>Why FAA HIMS Reform?</h2>
      <p>The FAA HIMS Program was built to help pilots with substance abuse or mental health issues. But pilots say it's become punitive, unscientific, and stigmatizing. Pilots with ADHD, PTSD, or depression are subject to the same harsh protocols as those recovering from addiction.</p>
