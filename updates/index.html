        <p>Analysis from <a href="https://move-p4hr.org" target="_blank">Pilots for HIMS Reform</a> and reform blogs highlights how the HIMS process has expanded beyond substance use, now encompassing mental health conditions like ADHD and PTSD with little differentiation, creating undue burden and stigma. “While it began as drug/alcohol, it no longer is JUST drug/alcohol. ... all of these cases go through the HIMS process.” <small>—Reddit pilot testimony</small></p>

        <p>On Reddit’s r/flying: “Regardless of what got you into the HIMS program ... you will be treated with the same social stigmas and unfairness.” This sentiment reflects widespread concern among pilots over one-size-fits-all oversight protocols.</p>

        <p>A federal appeals court ruled that FAA’s denial of a medical certificate for antidepressant use was “arbitrary and capricious,” opening doors to medical precedent and potentially reshaping HIMS protocols. <small>—Source: AOPA report</small></p>
